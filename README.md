You've been asked by develop a new website for Tattly, a company that designs cool temporary tattos.

Their designer sent over the following screen shot of the design. Your job is the create the markup and the styling for the site.


For now, don't worry about about making the links work. You can just put in a place holder link, ex `<a href="#">A link to no where</a>`


For the font, use "Arial Narrow" for all titles and "Helvetica Neue" for non-title text.

It will be really hard to get this pixel perfect. Do your best but don't kill yourself. The objective is to get practice using semantic markup, and css positioning and layout.
